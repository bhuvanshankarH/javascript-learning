// alert("Im working"); // it shows an dialogue box iver the window 

// Variables 

// variables are like storage box which is used to store data for operations 

// let person = "Bhuvan"  es6 version and it is also variable / changable

// const person = "Bhuvan" once declared cannot be reassigned 

// var person = "Bhuvan"  old version not recommended 

//  !!! note use const more than let because it is recommended !!!

// rules for naming the variable 

// variable must need to start with alphabets $ and _ signs 

//  Variables should not start  with numbers 

//  variable should not be assigned with keyword

// Data Types in Javascript 

// numbers 
// booleans
// Float
// string 
// objects and 
//  Arrays 

// javascript is not a typed language so it does not require to add what type of data is stored in that varaible like c and java 
// we can also find the type of an data by using typeof keyword 

// let person = "bhuvan";
// console.log(typeof (person));

//             !!!Type conversion in javascript !!!

//  as javascript is not a typed language we can convert one form of data to another

// let person = "bhuvan"
// console.log(Number(person));

//  A quick note we cannot convert a string to a number it always return Nan (Not a number)

// let age = 21;
// console.log(String(age));
// console.log(typeof (age))

//  Boolean conversion 

// NOTE : in javascript all the non zero(0) data is returned as true and all the(zeros) are converted in to(false)
